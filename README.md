**Road Lane Line Detection System**

Road Lane Detection involves detecting the path for self-driving cars to ensure they stay within their designated lanes, thereby reducing the risk of entering other lanes unintentionally. This system reliably identifies lane locations and boundaries by analyzing visual inputs from onboard cameras.

# Assumptions
Driving on the Right Side: The system assumes driving on the right side of a two-lane road, as typically observed in many regions.

# Daylight Conditions: The system operates optimally under daylight conditions. Nighttime conditions haven't been tested due to limitations in video quality.

# Algorithms
Image Acquisition:
Cameras capture the forward view of the road, usually mounted on the vehicle's windshield near the rearview mirror.
Preprocessing:

# Grayscale Conversion: Convert color images to grayscale to simplify subsequent processing of lane markings.

# Gaussian Blur: Apply Gaussian blur to the grayscale image to reduce noise and smooth out the image.

# Edge Detection:
Utilize the Canny edge detection algorithm to detect edges within the preprocessed image.

# Kernel Hough Transformation:
Detect road boundary edges efficiently using a modified Hough Transformation variant.
This method enables real-time edge detection but might face framerate limitations due to hardware constraints.

# Region of Interest Selection:
Define a specific region of interest in the image where lane lines are expected, typically a trapezoidal area covering the lower half of the image.

# Lane Line Identification:
Filter line segments based on their slope and position to identify and distinguish left and right lane lines effectively.

# Lane Markings and Estimations:
Model lane curvature and ensure smooth lane lines for improved stability and navigation.

# Output of Road Lane Line Detection: 
The system outputs annotated images or video streams where detected lane lines are highlighted, aiding in visualizing the vehicle's path relative to lane boundaries.
